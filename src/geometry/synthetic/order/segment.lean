# Order on incidence geometry and segments

This file formalises betweenness based on `incidence_geometry`, defines line segments
and proves some important lemmas such as Pasch's.

## Main definitions

* `incidence_order_geometry` is a class extended by `incidence_geometry` and defines
  a ternary relation `between` satisfying some axioms.

* `seg`, with notation `-ₛ`, is the unique segment determined by the given two points.

## References

* See [Geometry: Euclid and Beyond]

/--An incidence order geometry is an incidence geometry with betweenness, a ternary relation
for `pts`. `between a b c` means `b` is between `a` and `c`, restricted by some axioms :
B1 : If a point is between the other two, they are col.
B2 : We can extend two distinct points.
B3 : Given 3 distinct points, exactly one of them is between the other two.
B4 : Pasch's axiom. `a`, `b`, `c` are noncol and for a line `l` not containing any of them,
     if `l` contains a points between `a` and `b`, it contains a points either between `a` and
     `c` or between `b` and `c`.
